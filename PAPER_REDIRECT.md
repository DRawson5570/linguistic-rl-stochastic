# Paper Location

## ⚠️ The academic paper has been split into two separate documents:

### 1. **Self-Modification via LoRA** (Proven Results)
👉 **[PAPER.md in self-modifying-lora repo](https://github.com/DRawson5570/self-modifying-lora/blob/main/PAPER.md)**

**Content:**
- Autonomous recursive self-improvement
- 20% → 45% accuracy (+125% improvement)
- Non-monotonic learning analysis
- LoRA architecture details
- Full experimental results
- ~10,000 words, ready for arXiv

**Status:** ✅ Complete, experimentally validated

---

### 2. **Linguistic RL for Stochastic Environments** (Future Work)
📋 **See STOCHASTIC_ENVIRONMENTS_DISCOVERY.md in this repo**

**Content:**
- Natural language framing for regime-aware learning
- Trading application design
- Meta-prompt architecture
- Hypothesis and roadmap

**Status:** ⏸️ Conceptual, not yet implemented

---

## Why the Split?

The original paper conflated two separate contributions:
1. **What was demonstrated:** Self-modification via LoRA (deterministic math problems)
2. **What was conceptualized:** Regime-aware learning (stochastic trading environments)

Proper scientific communication requires separating proven results from future vision.
